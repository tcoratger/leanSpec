Can you go with the py architect to sanity check the codebase everywhere to check that the code adheres to all the most modern Python principles. It must be extremely lean, clean, and compact so that it truly serves as a minimal running specification/client that is considered a reference worldwide. Therefore, take inspiration from the best repositories in the world, or even from the Python compiler itself, and create something perfect. Of course, as a specification, it's crucial that things are organized correctly and clearly, so we'll prioritize, for example, storing functions in objects rather than isolated functions, while avoiding excessive abstraction to prevent overly complexifying the codebase.
