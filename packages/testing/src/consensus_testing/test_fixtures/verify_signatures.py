    Test fixture for verifying signatures on a signed block.

    An optional ``tamper`` hook mutates the built signed block before
    verification runs. This is the only supported way to exercise
    signature-verification rejection paths that lie behind structural
    invariants the block builder normally upholds.

    Supported operations:

    - ``{"operation": "drop_last_signature"}``: Remove the last entry
      from the block's attestation_signatures list. Produces a signed
      block whose signature-group count is one less than its
      attestation count.
    - ``{"operation": "set_proposer_index", "value": int}``: Rewrite
      the block's proposer_index field. Use this to exercise the
      validator-bounds check that the builder skips because its round-
      robin selection stays within range by construction.
    - ``{"operation": "clear_first_attestation_bits"}``: Replace the
      first body attestation with one whose aggregation_bits carry no
      set bit. Exercises the empty-participants check inside
      signature verification.

    Tampered blocks bypass the builder's structural invariants. The
