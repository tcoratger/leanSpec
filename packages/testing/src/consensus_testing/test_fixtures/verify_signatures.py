    Test fixture for verifying signatures on a signed block.

    Generates a complete signed block from the block specification,

    An optional `tamper` hook mutates the built signed block before
    verification runs. This is the only supported way to exercise
    signature-verification rejection paths that lie behind structural
    invariants the block builder normally upholds.

    Optional post-build mutation applied before verification.

    Supported operations:

    - `{"operation": "set_proposer_index", "value": int}`: Rewrite
      the block's proposer_index field. Use this to exercise the
      validator-bounds check that the builder skips because its round-
      robin selection stays within range by construction.
    - `{"operation": "clear_first_attestation_bits"}`: Replace the
      first body attestation with one whose aggregation_bits carry no
      set bit. Exercises the empty-participants check inside
      signature verification.
    - `{"operation": "corrupt_proof"}`: Replace the merged proof with
      a short non-decodable blob. Exercises the Type-2 decode check.
    - `{"operation": "append_phantom_attestation"}`: Add a body
      attestation with no matching proof component. Exercises the
      component count check between the body and the merged proof.
    - `{"operation": "mutate_state_root"}`: Change a block field after
      signing so the block root differs. Exercises the per-component
      message binding that prevents reusing an honest proof under a
      different message.

    Tampered blocks bypass the builder's structural invariants. The
    resulting fixture pins the exact rejection a client must raise when
    receiving such a block from a peer.
