) -> None:
    """
    Blocks containing two aggregated attestations with identical data are rejected.

    Scenario
    --------
    - Slot 1: common ancestor block accepted by the store.
    - Slot 2: proposer builds a block whose body contains two aggregated
      attestations that reference identical data:
        - same slot
        - same target
        - same source
        - same validator set
      The two entries are appended via forced attestations so the builder's
      merge-by-data pass does not collapse them.

    Expected Behavior
    -----------------
    Fork-choice store rejects the block with AssertionError containing:
    "Block contains duplicate AttestationData"

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    Each unique AttestationData must appear at most once per block:

    - Prevents inflating attestation weight by repeating the same vote.
    - Keeps signature-aggregation accounting one-to-one with data.
    - Without this check, a proposer could double-count votes from a single
      validator set just by repeating the entry.
