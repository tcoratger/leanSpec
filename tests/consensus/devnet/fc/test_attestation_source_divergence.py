    Store justified advances from a minority fork; the next block catches up.

    Scenario
    --------
    Four validators. Two forks diverge from a common ancestor::

        genesis -> common(1) -> block_2(2) -> block_3(3)   (head, V0 weight)
                              \\
                               -> fork_4(4)                (V1+V2+V3 justify slot 1)

    After fork_4:

    - store.latest_justified = slot 1 (from fork B)
    - head = block_3 (fork A)
    - head_state.latest_justified = slot 0 (divergence)

    Self-healing
    ------------
    Block 5 is built on the head chain (no explicit attestations).
    The builder's fixed-point loop resolves the divergence:

    1. Pool contains fork B's attestations (source=0, target=1)
    2. Builder starts with current_justified=0 (head state)
    3. Fork B's attestations match (source=0). Included. Justifies slot 1.
    4. Divergence closed in one block.

    Expected post-state
    -------------------
    - After fork_4: store justified=1, head state justified=0
    - After block_5: both agree on justified=1
