    Scenario
    --------
    Build a real mid-chain anchor by advancing the genesis state through
    empty blocks. Seed the store from the resulting (state, block) pair.

    Chain shape at initialization::

        genesis(0) -> block(1) -> ... -> anchor(10)

    - Latest justified and latest finalized both reference the anchor root
      at the anchor's own slot (beacon-chain seeding convention).
    - Store clock is at the anchor slot (no pre-anchor intervals tracked).
    - The anchor block is the only entry in the store's block map.

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    A newly checkpoint-synced node must refuse to extend history below the
    anchor. The first check on that contract is that the anchor is all the
    store knows about, and is simultaneously treated as the current head and
    as the deepest trusted checkpoint.
