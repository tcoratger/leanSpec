Signature verification: structural rejection vectors for the merged proof.

These cover structural invariants a peer could break that the block
builder upholds by construction:

- the merged proof must decode,
- its component count must match the body plus the proposer,
- each component stays bound to the message it signed.

    cannot be decoded.

    Why This Matters

    The proof blob arrives over the wire.
    A peer can send arbitrary bytes.

    Why This Matters

    An honest proof reused under a different block is rejected.

    Scenario
    --------
    - Anchor state has 1 validator.
    - Block at slot 1 is signed honestly.
    - The tamper hook rewrites the block's state root after signing, so
      the block root differs while the proof is unchanged.

    Expected Behavior
    -----------------
    Verification fails with AssertionError: each proof component is bound
    to the message it signed, and the proposer component no longer
    matches the recomputed block root.

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    Without the per-component binding, honest signatures could be lifted
    onto attacker-chosen block or attestation data that resolves to the
    same public keys.
    Validators would be credited for messages they never signed, directly
    attackable for justification manipulation.
    This pins the binding that closes that hole.
