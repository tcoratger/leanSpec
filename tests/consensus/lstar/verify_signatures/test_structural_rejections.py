"""Signature verification: structural rejection vectors for the merged proof.

These cover structural invariants a peer could break that the block
builder upholds by construction:

- the merged proof must decode,
- its component count must match the body plus the proposer,
- each component stays bound to the message it signed.

    cannot be decoded.

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    The proof blob arrives over the wire.
    A peer can send arbitrary bytes.

    Why This Matters

    Scenario
    --------
    - Anchor state has 1 validator.

    - The tamper hook rewrites the block's state root after signing, so
      the block root differs while the proof is unchanged.

    Expected Behavior
    -----------------
    Verification fails with AssertionError: each proof component is bound
    to the message it signed, and the proposer component no longer
    matches the recomputed block root.

    Why This Matters
    ----------------
    Without the per-component binding, honest signatures could be lifted
    onto attacker-chosen block or attestation data that resolves to the
    same public keys.
    Validators would be credited for messages they never signed, directly
    attackable for justification manipulation.
