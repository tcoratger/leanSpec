"""Tests for post-block Type-1 deconstruction in SyncService.

Exercises `SyncService._deconstruct_block_into_store`: for every processed
block (gossip, head-sync, or backfilled), the merged Type-2 proof is split
into per-attestation Type-1 proofs, merged with locally held partials, and
written into the pending pool, replacing the partials it subsumes.

Deconstruction only runs for an attestation when:

- its target is ahead of the store's justified checkpoint, so the proof
  can still help move justification, and
- it adds at least one participant the node does not already hold.

Only the decision/gate paths are exercised here. The split itself
(`split_type_2_by_msg`) is implemented and works in the production prover,
but the upstream `lean_multisig` `test-config` build aborts it with an
in-circuit assertion (the reduced XMSS dimensions are inconsistent with
the aggregation program's split branch). It is not a leanSpec defect and
cannot be fixed here, so the split-extract-merge body is verified under a
production prover, not in this test-mode suite.
