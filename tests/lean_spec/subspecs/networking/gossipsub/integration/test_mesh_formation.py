"""Mesh formation with multiple peers.

Gossipsub controls mesh size with three parameters:

- D: target mesh degree (desired number of mesh peers)
- D_low: lower bound -- below this, heartbeat GRAFTs new peers
- D_high: upper bound -- above this, heartbeat PRUNEs excess peers

Each heartbeat round moves every node's mesh closer to [D_low, D_high].
Multiple rounds are needed because GRAFT/PRUNE propagation is async
and one node's change can ripple through the network.
