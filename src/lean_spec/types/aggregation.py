"""
Validator participation: bitlist + index-list pair.

Two SSZ types co-located because they round-trip:

- `AggregationBits.to_validator_indices()` returns the indices set in the bitlist.
- `ValidatorIndices.to_aggregation_bits()` packs an index list back into bits.

Both are sized by `VALIDATOR_REGISTRY_LIMIT`. The shape is inherited by every
validator-keyed bitfield and index list across the spec.
