        Produce an attestation for the given slot and validator.

        This method constructs an Attestation object according to the lean protocol
        specification for attestation. The attestation represents the
        validator's view of the chain state and their choice for the
        next justified checkpoint.

        The algorithm:
        1. Get the current head
        2. Calculate the appropriate attestation target using current forkchoice state
        3. Use the store's latest justified checkpoint as the attestation source
        4. Construct and return the complete Attestation object

        Args:
            slot: The slot for which to produce the attestation.
            validator_index: The validator index producing the attestation.

            A fully constructed Attestation object ready for signing and broadcast.
