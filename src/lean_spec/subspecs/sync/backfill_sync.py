"""
Backfill synchronization for resolving orphan blocks.

When a block arrives whose parent is unknown, we need to fetch that parent.
If the parent also has an unknown parent, we continue recursively. This process
is called "backfill" because we are filling in gaps going backward in time.

The Challenge

Blocks can arrive out of order for several reasons:

1. **Gossip timing**: A child block gossips faster than its parent
2. **Parallel downloads**: Responses arrive in different order than requests
3. **Network partitions**: Some blocks were missed during a brief disconnect

Without backfill, these orphan blocks would be useless. With backfill, we can
resolve them once their parents arrive or are explicitly fetched.

How It Works

1. Track orphan blocks in the BlockCache
2. When an orphan is detected, request its parent from peers
3. If the fetched parent is also an orphan, request its parent
4. Continue recursively up to MAX_BACKFILL_DEPTH (512)
5. Once a parent chain is complete, process all waiting blocks

This is more memory-efficient than downloading the entire chain upfront,
and handles dynamic gaps naturally.

Depth Limiting

Backfill depth is limited to prevent attacks and resource exhaustion:

- An attacker could send a block claiming to have a parent millions of slots ago
- Without limits, we would exhaust memory trying to fetch the entire chain
- MAX_BACKFILL_DEPTH (512) covers legitimate reorgs while bounding resources

    Resolves orphan blocks by fetching missing parent chains.

    BackfillSync is the reactive component of the sync service. When blocks
    arrive with unknown parents, this class orchestrates fetching those parents.

    How It Works

    1. **Detection**: BlockCache marks blocks as orphans when added
    2. **Request**: BackfillSync requests missing parents from peers
    3. **Recursion**: If fetched parents are also orphans, continue fetching
    4. **Resolution**: When parent chain is complete, blocks become processable

    Integration

    BackfillSync does not process blocks itself. It only ensures parents exist
    in the BlockCache. The SyncService is responsible for:

    - Triggering backfill when orphans are detected
    - Processing blocks when they become processable
    - Integrating blocks into the Store
