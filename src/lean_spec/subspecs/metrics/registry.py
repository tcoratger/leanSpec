"""
Prometheus metric definitions aligned with the leanMetrics spec.

Names, types, and buckets match
https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanMetrics/blob/main/metrics.md

This module uses the null object pattern for zero-cost metrics before
initialization. Every metric attribute starts as a silent no-op stub.
After initialization, stubs are replaced with real Prometheus objects.

This design gives consumers a stable API at import time.
No "is metrics enabled?" checks are needed anywhere in the codebase.
Code that records metrics works identically whether the Prometheus
subsystem is active or not.
