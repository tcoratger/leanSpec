"""
Validator service for producing blocks and attestations.

The Validator Problem
---------------------
Ethereum consensus requires active participation from validators.

At specific intervals within each slot, validators must:
- Interval 0: Propose blocks (if scheduled)
- Interval 1: Create attestations

This service drives validator duties by monitoring the slot clock
and triggering production at the appropriate intervals.

Proposer Attestation Design
---------------------------
Each validator attests exactly once per slot.

However, proposers and non-proposers attest at different times:
- Proposers attest at interval 0, bundled inside their block
- Non-proposers attest at interval 1, broadcast separately

This design has two benefits:
1. Proposers see their own attestation immediately (no network delay)
2. Non-proposers can attest to a block they actually received

The proposer's attestation is embedded in a block wrapper alongside
the block itself. At interval 1, we skip proposers because they already
attested. This prevents double-attestation.
