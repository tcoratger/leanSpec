"""
SQLite database implementation for consensus data storage.

This module provides persistent storage for Ethereum consensus data:

- Blocks and states indexed by their SSZ root hash
- Checkpoints for tracking justification and finalization
- Attestations indexed by validator
- Slot-to-root mappings for historical queries
- State root to block root index for checkpoint sync

All data is stored as SSZ-encoded bytes in BLOB columns.
The SSZ format ensures deterministic serialization across implementations.

Writes are not auto-committed. Callers must use batch_write() for multi-write
atomicity or commit() for single-write durability.
