"""
Network service that routes events to sync.

The Problem
-----------
The network layer (libp2p) produces events: blocks arrive via gossip,
peers send status messages, connections come and go. These events need
to reach the consensus layer to update forkchoice state.

The network service is the bridge. It:

1. Consumes events from an abstract source (async iterator)
2. Routes each event to the appropriate sync handler
3. Publishes locally-produced blocks and attestations to peers
4. Runs until stopped or the source exhausts

This means:
- The network layer produces events,
- A routing service dispatches them,
- The consensus layer handles each event type with dedicated logic.
