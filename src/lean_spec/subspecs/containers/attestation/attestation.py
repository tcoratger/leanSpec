"""
Attestation-related container definitions.

Attestations are how validators express their view of the chain.
Each attestation specifies:

- What the validator thinks is the chain head
- What is already justified (source)
- What should be justified next (target)

Attestations can be aggregated to save space, but the current specification
doesn't do this yet.
