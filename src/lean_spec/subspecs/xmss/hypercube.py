"""
Implements the mathematical operations for hypercube layers.

This module provides the necessary functions to work with vertices in a
v-dimensional hypercube with coordinates in the range [0, w-1]. A key concept
is the partitioning of the hypercube's vertices into "layers". A vertex belongs
to layer `d`, where `d` is its distance from the sink vertex `(w-1, ..., w-1)`.

The core functionalities are:
1.  **Precomputation and Caching**: Efficiently calculates and caches the sizes
    of each layer for different hypercube configurations (`w` and `v`).
2.  **Mapping**: Provides bijective mappings between an integer index within a
    layer and the unique vertex (a list of coordinates) it represents.

This logic is a direct translation of the algorithms described in the paper
"At the top of the hypercube" (eprint 2025/889)
and the reference Rust implementation: https://github.com/b-wagn/hash-sig.
