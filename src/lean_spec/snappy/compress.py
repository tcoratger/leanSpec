Snappy compression implementation.

This module implements the compression (encoding) side of the Snappy codec.


WHAT IS SNAPPY?
---------------
Snappy is an LZ77-variant compression algorithm developed by Google.
It prioritizes speed over compression ratio.


HOW COMPRESSION WORKS
---------------------
The algorithm scans input data looking for repeated byte sequences.

When it finds a repeat, instead of storing the bytes again, it stores:
  "Go back X bytes and copy Y bytes from there."

This is called a "copy" or "backreference".

Bytes that don't repeat are stored as-is. These are called "literals".


Example:
-------
Input:  "ABCDABCD" (8 bytes)

The compressor sees:
  - Position 0-3: "ABCD" (no match yet, emit as literal)
  - Position 4-7: "ABCD" (matches position 0!)

Output:
  - Literal: "ABCD" (4 bytes)
  - Copy: go back 4, copy 4

Result: 4 literal bytes + 1 copy tag ≈ 6 bytes (saved 2 bytes).


THE HASH TABLE
--------------
To find matches quickly, we use a hash table.

For each position, we:
  1. Hash the next 4 bytes.
  2. Look up the hash in the table.
  3. If found, check if the bytes actually match (hash collisions exist).
  4. Store our current position in the table for future lookups.

This gives O(1) match lookup per position.


BLOCK PROCESSING
----------------
Large inputs are split into 64KB blocks.
Each block is compressed independently.

This bounds memory usage and enables streaming.
