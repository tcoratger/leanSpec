Sparse Merkle subtrees for the top-bottom traversal of an XMSS key.

# Overview

The long-lived public key of an XMSS signature is the root of one Merkle tree.
That tree commits to one one-time public key per slot of the key's lifetime.
A signature opens the leaf for its slot with a path of sibling hashes up to the root.

A full lifetime tree has one leaf per slot.
For a lifetime of 2^32 slots, holding every node in memory is infeasible.

# The top-bottom split

The tree is cut into one top tree sitting above many bottom trees.
Each bottom tree covers a contiguous run of leaves, the square root of the lifetime of them.
There are that many bottom trees, and their roots are exactly the leaves of the top tree.

The signer keeps the whole top tree resident, plus the bottom trees around the active slot.
As the active slot advances, stale bottom trees are dropped and fresh ones regenerated on demand.
Resident memory stays near the square root of the lifetime instead of the full lifetime.

# Sparse layers

Only a window of leaves is resident, so a stored layer holds a contiguous slice, not a full level.
Each layer records the absolute index of its first node, keeping positions in full-tree coordinates.

    Recompute a root from a leaf and its opening, then compare against a trusted root.

    # Overview

    Verification mirrors construction in reverse.
    The leaf is hashed, then folded with each sibling while climbing one level per step.
    The walk succeeds when the recomputed root equals the trusted root.

    # Why return false instead of raising

    The opening arrives inside an untrusted signature.
    A malformed opening must be a quiet verification failure, never a crash.
    So out-of-range input returns false rather than raising.

    Args:
        poseidon: Cached Poseidon engine.
        config: Active XMSS configuration.
        parameter: Public parameter for the hash function.
        root: Trusted root taken from the public key.
        position: Absolute index of the leaf being verified.
        leaf_parts: Digests that constitute the original leaf.
        opening: Sibling path from leaf to root.

    Returns:
        True when the path reconstructs the trusted root, false otherwise.
