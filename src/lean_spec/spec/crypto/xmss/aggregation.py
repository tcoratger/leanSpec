        # Overview

        Two kinds of contribution merge into one proof.

        - A fresh signer contributes a single raw signature.
        - A child proof contributes an already-aggregated bundle of signers.

        The result names the union of every contributing validator.
        The prover compresses all contributions into one proof over the shared message.

        # Why the index travels with each fresh signer

        A public key carries no validator index on its own.
        Pairing the index with each fresh entry lets the bitfield be derived, not passed in.
        An empty list of fresh signers simply contributes no indices.
