        Produce a block for the target slot.

        Returns the block alongside its per-attestation single-message
        aggregate proofs.

        Block production proceeds in four stages:
        1. Retrieve the current chain head as the parent block
        2. Verify proposer authorization for the target slot
        3. Build the block with maximal valid attestations
        4. Store the block and update checkpoints

        The block builder uses a fixed-point algorithm to collect attestations.
        Each iteration may update the justified checkpoint.

        Returns the per-attestation single-message aggregate proofs unmerged. The validator
        service signs the block root with the proposal key, wraps that into
        a singleton single-message aggregate, and merges all of them into the block-level
        multi-message aggregate proof carried by SignedBlock.proof.
