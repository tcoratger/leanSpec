"""
Container types for the Lean consensus specification.

This package is the public container surface for the lstar fork.
The types are split across submodules by domain role:

- interval, identifiers, participation: scalar units and registry index sets
- aggregation: post-quantum signature aggregation proofs
- validator: genesis configuration and the validator registry
- checkpoint: Casper-FFG checkpoints and the attestation vote they anchor
- attestation, block: vote envelopes and the blocks that carry them
- state, store: per-block consensus state and the node's fork-choice view
