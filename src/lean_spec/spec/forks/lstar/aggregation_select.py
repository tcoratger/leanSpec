    """
    Greedy set-cover over Type-1 proofs maximizing validator coverage.

    Iterates the proof sets in order, repeatedly picking the proof with the
    most uncovered validators until no further coverage is possible.
    Earlier proof sets are prioritized so gossip-fresh proofs win over
    already-known ones.

    The validator-index sets are materialized once per proof, not inside the
    inner max key, so the loop runs in O(P * V) instead of O(P^2 * V).

    Args:
        *proof_sets: One or more sets of Type-1 proofs, ordered by priority.
            None entries are skipped.

    Returns:
        The chosen proofs and the union of validator indices they cover.
