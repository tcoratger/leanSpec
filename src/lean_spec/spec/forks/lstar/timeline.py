        Advance store time by one interval and perform interval-specific actions.

        Each slot is split into five intervals so consensus work runs at fixed points
        relative to when a block arrives and votes spread across the network.

        Timing of the action points within a slot:

        - Interval 0: ingest the slot's pending votes once the proposal has landed.
        - Interval 2: aggregators bundle the slot's votes into proofs and broadcast them.
        - Interval 3: advance the safe target from the latest votes for fast confirmation.
        - Interval 4: ingest the votes that accumulated through the rest of the slot.

        Aggregation waits until interval 2 so a block proposed at the slot start has
        time to propagate and gather votes before they are bundled.
        Fast confirmation sits at interval 3, after aggregates exist, so the safe
        target reflects the freshest votes the node has seen.
