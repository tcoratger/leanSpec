        Recover per-attestation proofs from a processed block.

        On block import we already trust the block-attestation participant
        bitfields via spec on_block signature verification. The block carries
        one merged multi-message aggregate proof binding every attestation in its body.

        For each block attestation that covers validators not already held
        in the given store:

        1. Extract that data's single-message aggregate proof
           out of the block's multi-message aggregate proof.
        2. Merge it with all local partial single-message aggregate proofs for the same data
           into one single-message aggregate proof whose participant bits are the union.
        3. Write the combined proof into the pending pool.

        If the data was never seen locally, the extracted single-message aggregate is used

        Runs for every node, including non-validators, so the per-attestation
        proofs reach the local pool and contribute fork-choice weight after
        the next acceptance tick. Publishing is left to the caller and only
