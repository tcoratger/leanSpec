        On block import we already trust the block-attestation participant
        bitfields via spec on_block signature verification. The block carries
        one merged Type-2 proof binding every attestation in its body.

        For each block attestation that covers validators not already held
        in the given store:

        1. Extract that data's Type-1 proof out of the block's Type-2 proof.
        2. Merge it with all local partial Type-1 proofs for the same data
           into one Type-1 proof whose participant bits are the union.
        3. Write the combined proof into the pending pool.

        If the data was never seen locally, the extracted Type-1 is used

        Runs for every node, including non-validators, so the per-attestation
        proofs reach the local pool and contribute fork-choice weight after
        the next acceptance tick. Publishing is left to the caller and only
