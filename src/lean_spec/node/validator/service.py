"""
Validator service for producing blocks and attestations.

The Validator Problem
---------------------
Ethereum consensus requires active participation from validators.

At specific intervals within each slot, validators must:
- Interval 0: Propose blocks (if scheduled)
- Interval 1: Create attestations (broadcast to subnet topics only)

This service drives validator duties by monitoring the slot clock
and triggering production at the appropriate intervals.

Dual-Key Signing Design
------------------------
Each validator has two XMSS key pairs:

- **Proposal key**: Signs the block root (hash_tree_root(block)) during proposal
- **Attestation key**: Signs gossip attestations for aggregation

Proposers produce two signatures per slot:

1. Interval 0: Proposer signature over the block root (proposal key)
2. Interval 1: Gossip attestation like all other validators (attestation key)

These use independent keys, so OTS constraints do not conflict.
The proposer's attestation is not special — it flows through the normal
gossip/aggregation pipeline and gets included in a future block.
